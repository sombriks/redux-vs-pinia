Small experiment to see how achieve same result using pure vue, vue with pinia
and react with redux.

## The components

I want a certain set of behaviors here:

1. Login/logoff resets the filter and paginator.
1. Filter changes resets the paginator.
1. Each named element is a distinct component.

## Observed results
